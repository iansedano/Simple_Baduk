	group lists??
	cardinals...



PSEUDOCODE

two options for board
	board = [
				[{pos},{pos},{pos}],[{pos},{pos},{pos}],
				[{pos},{pos},{pos}],[{pos},{pos},{pos}],
				[{pos},{pos},{pos}],[{pos},{pos},{pos}]
				]

OR
	board = [{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos},{pos}]

VARS
	checkedList = []
	friendsToCheck = [] // utility list
	cardinals = [N,E,S,W]

CLASSES
	class position
		state = black, white, empty
		boardx = 1
		borady = 9

	class group
		liberties = 1
		colour = black, white
		positions = []

	class player
		colour = black, white
		prisoners = 0
		groups = []


function Check life()
	for each position in board
		if position.state == empty
			break
		if in checkedList
			break
		else
			groupBuilder(current position)
		if group is white
			add to white group list
		if group is black
			add to black group list
		if currentmove is in deadGroup
			if enemy also has deadGroup
				kill enemy deadGroup
			else
				break "illegal move"

function groupBuilder(position)
	colour = position.state
	copy position to friendsToCheck

	for each position in friendsToCheck
		if in checkedList
			remove current from friendsToCheck
			break

		checkFriend(position)
end

	for each cardinal
		if friend
			copy to friendsToCheck
		if empty
			liberties += 1

	remove current from friendsToCheck
	copy current to checkedList

return liberties
